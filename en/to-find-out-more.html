                        arrival of thousands of refugees in Europe, identity politics and the rise of populism,
                        overproduction and overconsumption … In 2022, these trends no longer surprise us, but it is
                        clearly more urgent than ever to change things.</p>
                    <p>After decades of unregulated and unconstrained production, having exhausted the world’s resources
                        without regard for the future, and misused the planet that hosts us and enables us to live, a
                        growing proportion of people have realised that we have gone too far. After all these wounds, we
                        need to explore the possibility of resilience, permitting us to change direction.</p>
                    <p>Experts in a wide range of scientific disciplines understand perfectly the problems associated
                        with climate warming and exhaustion of the planet’s resources. For environmental scientists,
                        health professionals, city planners and social scientists, the effects of these changes are
                        apparent and alarming at every level. Yet, paradoxically, scientists continue to find it
                        difficult to make their voices heard by political leaders or the wider public. This is evident
                        from the limited steps that have been taken to curb CO2 emissions and the negligible, even
                        non-existent responses to reports of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Even
                        when the scientific evidence is irrefutable, most people don’t know what they should do or lack
                        the means to act. In addition, political decisions follow a specific rhythm, dictated by the
                        election cycle. It is left to civil society, in all its multitudinous variety, to open the path
                        and force political change. It’s time for us all to act, every one of us in our own way.</p>

                        <h3>least: the arts and sciences support change</h3>
                        <p>least is an association whose aim is to grow, in the sense that everything must be built or
                            (re)created. It has a programme in the political sense of ‘programme’: a sequence of actions
                            designed to generate a result. least was born out of an awareness that took shape over
                            several years. It is based on reflections and discussions about the state of the world; the
                            state of the planet and humanity; shared professional experiences; the need to contribute to
                            the inevitable and positive changes that must be made; and the consequent obligation to
                            reinvent our practices, our vocations, our habits, all our everyday life..</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <p>Eight individuals from different disciplines came together to form least, a programme that
                            creates and accompanies participatory artistic, ecological, social and scientific
                            initiatives. Rooted in place, these initiatives interact directly with the world and aim to
                            startle into life collective awareness and the resilience of our ‘Earth system’. least is
                            therefore interested in science and wants to spread its knowledge by encouraging scientists
                            to make their expertise more accessible in practical ways to the public. In parallel, least
                            began a reflection on the vocation of the artist and the constraints of artistic production.
                            It concluded that artistic production must be re-imagined.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h3>The key components of least are the astonishing capacity of artists to think outside the
                            box, to invent and create, and the sharing of knowledge. least’s ambition is to contribute
                            to thinking and action that change the world.</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h3>A creative force rooted in reality</h3>
                        <p>least‘s mission is to create opportunities for stimulating thought, to question what is
                            around us, and open the door to new and different ideas that will help to construct a more
                            beautiful and fairer society and that respect the environment (understood broadly). In the
                            view of least’s founders, this can only be achieved by following two principles that are in
                            fact two subjective assumptions based on experience and intuition: break down barriers
                            between disciplines, and share ideas, knowledge and reflection. Acting on these, least will
                            encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and develop new and positive strategies to open
                            the way for the profound changes that must come. </p>
                        <p>Starting from the experiential recognition that art has an energy that can destroy boundaries
                            and limitations; having seen the capacity of artists to imagine, invent and concretise the
                            world we live in; having learned that non-performers who take part in artistic activity not
                            only learn but can develop their own ideas about its meaning and performance; having
                            observed how beautiful the meeting of performers and participants can be; and having
                            understood that the process of collaboration is more important and richer than the outcome,
                            those who founded least concluded that it should focus on participative projects –
                            principally joint creations that artists and participants make together – and on associated
                            actions that can be equally important.</p>
                        <p>To have effect, the power of art must be rooted in reality, in science, in everyday life
                            through dialogue with people. The work of artists brings benefit when it connects with the
                            heart (and voice) of society. Art must infuse the issues it touches, breath life and spirit
                            into them. Scientific and academic discourses tend to be constrained by their conventions
                            and rules. Dosing them with art will not just shake them up but suggest new ways of seeing
                            and thinking, from which they can only benefit.</p>

                    <p class="txt-copy-m">least inverts the standard model of cultural production by anchoring it
                        in reality, in the everyday. It promotes the development of artistic practices shared with
                        non-artists and invests in an innovative cross-disciplinary process that is novel for
                        Switzerland. least initiates and supports participatory artistic initiatives that rethink social
                        relations, sustainability and the distribution of knowledge. In a carefully designed framework,
                        it works long term and in specific local contexts. It brings together scientists, artists,
                        thinkers, engineers and economists to share knowledge and techniques, create and encourage
                        co-creation, experiment, take action together, share and learn, in order to renew society and
                        social relations by mobilising the resources of everyone. It encourages alternative models of
                        behaviour based on shared activities that challenge competitive individualism.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-block --outline">
                    <p>least works to realize the changes it predicts in artistic and cultural production by
                        reconceptualising its temporal assumptions, as well as models of financial and logistical
                        support. It proposes a creative approach that takes form over time and offers artists a
                        sustainable alternative. The artist’s role changes: no longer ‘entertainers’, they become
                        performers who accompany, invent, restore meaning and reconnect feeling and reason. In an
                        interdisciplinary group, their contribution is to ground action-research in reality while
                        supplying a vision that is offbeat and fertile.</p>
                    <p>Finally, least asserts the right to art without audiences. The aim of the programme is to engage
                        the ‘participating community’ rather than a ‘receptive audience’. In other words, projects are
                        designed first and foremost for the individuals and groups who are directly involved in them.
                        These might be, for example, a school class or a group of older people, members of a local
                        community or managers of a company, members of a choir or a group of Carthusian monks. Rather
                        than producing a performance, the focus is on the process of creating (conception, reflection,
                        discussion, construction), on the action involved, on the doing of it. In association with
                        scientists and participants, least wants to develop experiments and experiences, to think and
                        produce in common.</p>
                    <p>This idea is central: it is by meeting and sharing knowledge and ideas that
                        each person can learn, understand, change behaviour, and so participate in change.</p>
